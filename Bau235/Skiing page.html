<h1>Skiing is a Big Part of My Life... </h1>
<P> I started skiing when I was 11 years old and it instantly became an obsession of mine.
    I have travels far and wide to ski; From Sunday River to Breckenridge.

The shop that I work at is Boston Ski and Tennis. They trained me to be able to fix any part of my ski. From bindings to a blown out edge. <A HREF="https://www.bostonskiandtennis.com"> CHECK OUT THE SHOP HERE </A>.
